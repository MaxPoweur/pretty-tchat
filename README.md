# PrettyTchat

## Presentation
With this project, we offer you a truly instant messaging service (simple but effective), because this project was designed to promote an innovative and **web-optimized technology stack**.

> Were used in this project:
> - **Vue.js** (with scss, webpack, babel, localstorage...)
> - **ServerLess** implementation with Hasura
> - **Hasura** (schema sticher), which generates and provides a GraphQL API Schema
> - **GraphQL** client library (Vue-Apollo), with real-time database interactions (called subscriptions)

It should be noted that the project was carried out **as part of a Web TP** for my school *Polytech Angers*.
